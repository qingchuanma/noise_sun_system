Instruction (we tried to make it as a GH page but the background didn't show up, so we put the whole code here.)
To implement the code you can follow these steps:

1.clone the project to your computer<br />
2.run ' npm install ' (make sure you have npm and vite in your environment)<br />
3.run ' npm run dev '<br />
4.open from localhost<br />

Here are some keyboard event to do some operations.
-press 'q' to see the background<br />
-press 'enter' to see the explosion<br />
-press 'space' to back to the original scene<br />
-using your mouse to see in different perspectives<br />
Pleas try to refresh the webpage if there's anything wrong.
